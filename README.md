# Sapphire_Plus_Trident


3 axis and XY axis is base on VORON Trident.

Top moder mount is base on ratrig.

Thank you for VORON Design and Ratrig.

I have either modified or newly  Almost modeled everything to fit the Sapphire Plus frame.

The bed is capable of using the full size and the Z-axis can also be used for 300mm or more.

Aready Many users in Korea verified Sapphire plus trident.

Some users also made improvements.

Users from several other countries have also seen my YouTube channel and requested files.

So I decide uploading and sharing my github.

If there is a problem with the file, we will delete it.
